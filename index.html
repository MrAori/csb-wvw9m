It's also recommended to try this on computers, it may work on mobiles but performance may vary. This is for testing purposes only. </p> <p> To get started, press the play button underneath </p> <button id="startButton">Play</button> <h3>Created by Mason Howe | with THREE.JS and Tone.js</h3> </div> <div id="gui-container"></div> <script src="/csb-wvw9m/src.fc0674e6.js"></script> </body></html>
